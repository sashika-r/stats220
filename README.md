# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in design and science. 
- I am taking STATS 220 because I would like to gain a better understanding of the capabilites of R programming. 
- I am interested in learning about how to solve data-analytical problems.
